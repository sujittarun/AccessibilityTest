## Brief Summary
* Most of the issues where with **ARIA** attribute where WCAG standards are missing. If ARIA attribute is not as per standard it might effect the text to speech tools where it might not read out properly.
* Few are not having unique ID attributes. entire DOm should have unique id values for all elements on page.
* Form elemnt doesn't have lable. This will also be an issue for text to speech tools if there is no lable.
* There are many elements without landmark, this is one more problem for screen readers.
